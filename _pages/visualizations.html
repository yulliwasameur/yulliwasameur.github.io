<p> As part of my research and teaching, I enjoy producing visualizations to effectively convey information to the viewer. 
  This page shows some visualizations from recent works. </p>

<p> About: A sunburst plot showing the carbon footprint (kg CO2eq / kg) and macronutrients of 404 dishes grouped by their dish type. 
    There are 13 dish types: Beef, pork, poultry, seafood, soup, rice & noodles, eggs & beans, sauce, vegetable, 
    congee, sweet soup, dessert and fruit. The colours on the chart reflect the value of the carbon footprint 
    in kgCO2e per kg of a dish. Upon hovering on a dish, nutritional information also becomes available. 
    Clicking on a particular dish type would expand that category to show all the dishes within.
